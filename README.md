## SpaceX Invaders

SpaceX Invaders was a project for one of my classes and is written in Java with Swing.

Plot: The year is 2030.  Trump is still going strong as president of the United States.  You will play as the aliens, defending Mars from Elon Musk and his evil SpaceX crew [tragic, I know].   Elon and his crew are attempting to inhabit the last livable planet of our solar system.  Be a hero and stop them!



### Features

- Shields (similar to original game) which are destroyed by both Aliens and SpaceXShips (but do not destroy SpaceXShips)
